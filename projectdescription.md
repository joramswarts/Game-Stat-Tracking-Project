# Project Description: Game Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This is a Data Engineering project focused on collecting and analyzing in-game user data. The main objective of this project is to retrieve data and user data from League of Legends via the Riot API. Users should be able to run the program, input the in-game username for which they want to collect data. The project not only focuses on providing detailed statistics through a Jupyter Notebook but also introduces automatic data storage to an Azure database. Furthermore, a user-friendly PowerBI dashboard has been implemented to present the data in an accessible manner for users without programming knowledge.

## Motivation
This project is driven by a personal interest in monitoring in-game statistics and the competitive aspect of gaming. The use of stat-trackers to view in-game data has always captured my attention, and I want to combine this interest with my programming knowledge and skills to achieve more.

## Project Goals
This project has multiple goals:

- Retrieving data from League of Legends through an API.
- Collecting user data and statistics from an API.
- Storing user data and statistics in an Azure database automatically.
- Developing a Jupyter Notebook in which users can input a in-game username and generate detailed statistics.
- Creating a PowerBI dashboard to visually represent general statistics for a more intuitive user experience.
