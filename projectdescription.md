# Project Description: Game Data Analytics

## Project Overview
This is a Data Engineering project focused on collecting and analyzing in-game user data. The main objective of this project is to retrieve data and user data from League of Legends via the Riot API. Users should be able to run the program, input the in-game username for which they want to collect data. Subsequently, relevant data will be retrieved and visualized to provide insights into the statistics of that game. As an additional feature, the consideration of creating a PowerBI dashboard to display the data in a user-friendly manner for users without programming knowledge is also on the table.

## Motivation
This project is driven by a personal interest in monitoring in-game statistics and the competitive aspect of gaming. The use of stat-trackers to view in-game data has always captured my attention, and I want to combine this interest with my programming knowledge and skills to achieve more.

## Project Goals
This project has multiple goals:

- Retrieving data from League of Legends through an API.
- Collecting user data and statistics from an API.
- Developing a Jupyter Notebook in which users can input a in-game username and generate detailed statistics.
- Optionally, if time allows, creating a PowerBI dashboard that displays general statistics in a user-friendly manner.
- Create a option for users to save their data to our azure database, the next time someone tries to check their data, first look if its already in the database before scraping.
